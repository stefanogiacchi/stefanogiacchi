# 👋 Hi, I'm Stefano Giacchi  
### 🛠️ Cloud Architect • Problem Solver • Enterprise Systems Fixer

I help companies solve **high-complexity architectural, delivery and integration problems**.  
20+ years of experience across **Azure, .NET, DevOps, distributed systems, enterprise integration and data platforms**.

I'm the person teams call when:

- a project is stuck  
- architectural decisions are unclear  
- performance is collapsing  
- systems fail under pressure  
- complex integrations must be designed  
- business and technology need alignment  

I combine **architecture**, **coding**, **DevOps**, and **strategic problem solving**  
to bring clarity and accelerate enterprise delivery.
